Welcome. CASH is a nonprofit open source organization building digital tools for 
artists and labels. This platform makes web easier for musicians. It's a 
no-programming environment that allows complicated ideas to be built without 
complicated code.

The platform is built on top of PHP/LAMP with a simple but extensible request/response 
model with a full user-facing admin app. Complex workflows can be stored as "elements" 
in the system, and accessed by end users in a central "app store" style interface.
